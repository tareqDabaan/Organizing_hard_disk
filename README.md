# Organizing_hard_disk
A simple python script using the power of python automation, which is used to organize your hard disk so by running it, files will be organized each in a specific folder depending on
it's extension. 
So images will be organized in a specific folder and also pdf files and code files ... etc.
Your downloads directory might include a lots of files and apps which are not organized and that will make it hard on you to specify each one in a folder, just run the code and you're disk will be organized in a perfect and readable way. 
The code can be scheduled to run at a specific time for example, every week or every day or as you wish (but you will need to install pyinstaller package to do that) and after installing, you can schedule it as you want!
